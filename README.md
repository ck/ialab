# Immutant Aleph Lab #

Experiments with [Immutant][immutant] and [Aleph][aleph].

## Development ##

Deploy to local Immutant instance

```
lein immutant deploy
```

Start Immutant

```
lein immutant run
```

This starts the system automagically.

A TCP server listens on port 4444 for strings.
To send a message execute

```
echo hello | nc localhost 4444
```


## Build ##

The (recommended) deployment artifact is an Immutant archive,
which can be build by running

```
lein with-profile production immutant archive
```

The resulting file, `ialab.ima`, can then be deployed.
